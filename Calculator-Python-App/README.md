# CalculatorPython
Overview
The Simple Calculator is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user. It prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers, and then displays the result of the operation.

Features
1) Arithmetic Operations: The program supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
2) Input Validation: Input validation is performed to ensure that the user provides valid numeric input and that division by zero is avoided.
3) Error Handling: The program raises a ValueError if the user attempts to divide by zero and provides appropriate error messages.

How to Use
1) Running the Program: Execute the calculator.py file using a Python interpreter.
2) Enter Operator and Numbers: When prompted, enter the desired arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and two numbers.
3) View Result: The program will display the result of the arithmetic operation.
